# C-MiniGame

#This is one of the projects that I did when I was in college takeing a C++ prorgramming class :D <br/>
#The code was lost because my Apple Macbook was stolen but I somehow just found an old USB recently and it has most of the code on it so I decided to put it on github such that it won't get lost anymore.
